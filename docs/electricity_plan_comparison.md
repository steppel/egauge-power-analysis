## 🎓 Easy Explanation for Non-Tech People

Think of it like a gym membership:

### Tesla Electric = Pay-per-visit gym

- Go 30 times/month = $300
- **You pay for every single use**

### GreenMountain = Unlimited Night Access gym
- Daytime visits: $10 each
- Night visits (8pm-6am): FREE
- Go 15 times during day = $150
- Go 15 times at night = $0
- **Total: $150 instead of $300**

**Same amount of exercise, half the cost, just by timing it right!**
